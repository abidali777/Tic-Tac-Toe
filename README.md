# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file.
2. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 board.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all spaces on the board are filled without any player achieving three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Clean and efficient Python code.
- Interactive command-line interface.
- Handles player inputs and checks for winners or draws.
- Provides visual feedback with a printed game board.
